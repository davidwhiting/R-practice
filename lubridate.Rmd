```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Here we use the `lubridate` package to deal with dates and times
```{r}
library(tidyverse)

library(lubridate)
library(nycflights13)
```

And see if it's loaded correctly
```{r}
today()
now()
```

Now load a csv file
```{r}
mtcars <- read_csv(readr_example("mtcars.csv"))
```

The `read_delim()` is the most general, where we can define any delimiter. The `read_log()` is for apache-style log files. We can also use the `webreadr` library for other types of log files.
